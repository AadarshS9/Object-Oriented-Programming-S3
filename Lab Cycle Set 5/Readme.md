LAB CYCLE – SET 5

11. INHERITANCE USING ABSTRACT CLASS :
Write a C++ program to create an abstract class named “Shape” that contains an empty method
named numberOfSides(). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such
that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the
method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures.

12. VIRTUAL BASE CLASS :
Implement a student class representing name and roll. No and two derived classes “subject” and
“language”. The “subject” and “language” class will have subjects and languages opted by
students as data members. These two classes are used as the base classes to derive a new class
“result” class, having the functionality to enter the marks of both subject and language and print
the marklist for a student. Write a program to print the marklist of student using virtual base
class.

13. VIRTUAL FUNCTION:
Create a class called student with Roll no., name, mark1 and mark2 as member variables and
find the total using a seperate member function. Include a constructor function that reads the
member variable from the user. Include showData() member function to display the details.

Derive a new class minorcourse from student class, with minorm1,minorm2,minor m3 as data
members and showData() as a member function by using function overriding. Define a base
class pointer in main() function to display showData() from student class and minorcourse
class. Use virtual function.

14. EXCEPTION HANDLING :
Write a program to overload ++ operator to rotate an integer array element to left side. eg.
array[5]=[0,1,2,3,4], output of array, if the statement is ++i,where i=2 which is accepted from
user, is [2,3,4,0,1]. Write a program with proper exception handling, to ensure the value of i in
between 0 to 4.
