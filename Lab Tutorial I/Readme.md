Quote: The line between "inspiration" and "plagiarism" is often so thin.

1.  Write an object-oriented C++ program toimplement the addition of three complex numbers and subtraction of two complex
numbers with separate functions for each operation.  

2. Write an object-oriented C++  program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as follows:

3. Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two functions. The first function named
'setDim' takes the length and breadth of the rectangle as parameters and the second function named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth are passed as parameters in setDim(3,4) function.

4.    Write a menu-driven program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following functions and print the final salary. 
1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameters      
2 - 'AddSal()' which adds Rs.500 to the salary of the employee if it is less than Rs.5000.
