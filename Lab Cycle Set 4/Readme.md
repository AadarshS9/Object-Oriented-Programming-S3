LAB CYCLE – SET 4

8. FUNCTION OVERLOADING :
Create a class point with the following instance variable and methods. Develop C++ program
using menu – driven approach.
Member variables: private int x,y
Constructors : public Point(), Point(int x, int y)
Methods : public void setX(int x), setY(int y), setXY(int x, int y)
public void Sum(x,y);//Sum of x and y
public void Sum(x); //Sum of digits of x/y

9. OPERATOR OVERLOADING :
Implement a class string containing the following functions. Develop C++ program using menu - driven approach.
- Overload + operator to carry out the concatenation of strings.
- Overload = operator to carry out string copy.
- Overload - operator to carry out sub-string removal.
- Overload <= operator to carry out the comparison of strings.
- Overload ++ operator to change string characters to upper case
- Overload -- operator to change string characters to lower case
- Function to display the length of a string.

10.FRIEND FUNCTION :
Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as savings
account and other as current account. Create a class account that stores customer name,
account number and type of account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make
them more specific to their requirements. Include necessary member functions to achieve the
following tasks. Develop C++ program using menu – driven approach.
i. Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
ii. Display the balance.
iii. Compute and deposit interest.
iv. Permit withdrawal and update balance.
