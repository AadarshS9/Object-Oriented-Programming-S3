5. INHERITANCE:
  Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains the following members:...
  Write a C++ program that creates a class named 'Employee'. Define two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' which inherit the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same. Use Constructor to read data from the keyboard for both classes.

6. MULTIPLE INHERITANCE :
  Given the two base classes with the following members. Create a new class REPORT inherited from student and sports classes. Write a C++ program to implement the above by using multiple inheritances.
  
 7. MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE :
  Given the two base classes with the following members. Create a new class TEST inherited from the STUDENT class. Write a C++ program to implement the above by using multilevel inheritances.
